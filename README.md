This repository contains the scripts used for the paper *Multiomics machine learning identifies sleep and inflammation molecular pathways in prodromal Alzheimerâ€™s Disease* (https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.03.02.23286674). It includes scripts for data preprocessing, machine learning models training and the code used to create the figures of the manuscript. In this paper, we wanted to identify early disease pathways involved in the conversion to AD. To this end, we analyzed both proteomics and metabolomics data from participants in the European Medical Information Framework for Alzheimer's Disease (EMIF-AD) Multimodal Biomarker Discovery Study using four machine learning algorithms. Our study aims to address two main research questions: 1) which proteins and metabolites are most relevant in differentiating between controls, MCI, and AD? and 2) which proteins and metabolites are most relevant in differentiating between MCI stable and MCI converter? Our results indicate the presence of pathways related to inflammation, sleep, neural proteins, and protein degradation. Further exploring the inflammation connection, we studied microglia in vitro and discovered that they secreted an endocannabinoid called oleamide.
