Steps followed to get the results for the ML models:

1. Run each algorithm for each dataset in separate files:
•	load data and apply rebalancing with SMOTE if necessary
•	split the dataset into training and test sets
•	fit the model to the dataset
•	select hyperparameters
•	run GridSearch with cross-validation to get best model - repeat previous step if maximum value of one of the parameters is returned as highest accuracy 


2. Get output from the models by running remaining cells in the files:
•	accuracy on test set
•	ROC curve (with cross-validation for binary datasets / single plot for multi-class) 
•	calculate and plot features of importance
•	plot ROC curve with shuffle-split method for binary datasets to validate results
